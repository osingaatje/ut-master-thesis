gram. It examines the challenges and implications of TAs in grading, with a focus on their expertise and
grading consistency. The paper analyzes grading experiences in various exam settings and investigates the
impact on assessment quality. We adopt an empirical methodology and answer the research question by an-
alyzing the data from two exams. The chosen exams have similar learning objectives but they differ in how
TAs graded them, thus providing an opportunity to reflect on different grading styles. It concludes with
recommendations for enhancing TA grading effectiveness, emphasizing the need for detailed rubrics, training,
and monitoring to ensure fair and reliable assessment in higher education.},
  comment    = {Groups of TAs (UTA, GTA, Ph.D). Helpful in scaling program size, but must be carefully evaluated and intervened by providing necessary training.
"TA evaluation should be standardized with (...) scrutiny to prevent outliers"

p.122: Best arrangement of TA grading: one question per TA, all TAs in one room to discuss, teachers must monitor closely, mix of experienced and junior TAs. Students should be present in review to flag wrong grading etc.

Also: p.122 "If mistakes are spotted during [a] review, audit all exams graded by the TA for whom a mistake was spotted"

Grading rubric in Figure 3 seems very appropriate for autograding!},
